The R script does the following:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set by reading the files, assigning column names and then merging.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement by reading the column names, creating a vector and then making the relevant subset.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
